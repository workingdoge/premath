Rewired Python surfaces to thin transport (`tools/ci/required_gate_ref_client.py`) and updated `run_required_checks.py` + `emit_gate_witness.py` to consume core results instead of local semantic assembly. Added Rust unit tests, CLI smoke (`required_gate_ref_json_smoke`), Python client tests (`test_required_gate_ref_client.py`), `.mise.toml` pipeline wiring, docs updates (AGENTS + CI README), and Decision 0063. Validation passed: `cargo test -p premath-coherence required_gate_ref`, `cargo test -p premath-cli --test cli_smoke required_gate_ref_json_smoke`, `python3 tools/ci/test_required_gate_ref_client.py`, `mise run ci-pipeline-test`.\n\nProgress update (2026-02-22, slice 7): reduced Python wrapper encoding by deduplicating shared required-client transport into `tools/ci/core_cli_client.py` (premath binary resolution, temp-json input handoff, stale local binary retry-to-cargo, deterministic failure-class extraction, and JSON decode/retry handling). Rewired `required_delta/projection/witness/witness_verify/witness_decide/decision_verify/gate_ref` clients to keep only payload-shape validation + command metadata while preserving per-client failure classes. Validation passed: all seven required-client unit suites + `mise run ci-pipeline-test`.\n\nProgress update (2026-02-22, slice 8): moved `tools/ci/proposal_check_client.py` onto shared transport (`core_cli_client.run_core_json_command`) and preserved proposal-specific payload error class mapping (`proposal_nondeterministic`, `proposal_kcir_ref_mismatch`, `proposal_invalid_step`) over shared default transport failures. Validation passed: `python3 tools/ci/test_proposal_check_client.py` and `mise run ci-pipeline-test`.\n\nProgress update (2026-02-22, slice 9): routed instruction clients onto shared transport. `run_instruction_check` now uses core file-input transport (`run_core_json_command_from_path`) and `run_instruction_witness` now uses core payload-input transport (`run_core_json_command`) with preserved pre-execution argument semantics. Extended shared helper with path-input mode, extra arg support, and explicit invalid-json failure-class binding so instruction-check retains `instruction_envelope_invalid_shape` on parse failures. Validation passed: `python3 tools/ci/test_instruction_check_client.py` + `mise run ci-pipeline-test`.\n\nClosure update (2026-02-22): bd-34 migration objective met. Required-gate and instruction semantic checks now run through core command surfaces (`required-*`, `proposal-check`, `instruction-check`, `instruction-witness`) with Python wrappers reduced to transport/orchestration responsibilities. Deterministic parity is covered in CLI smoke + client suites + `ci-pipeline-test`, and pre-push closure gates (`ci-required-attested`) pass on all migration slices.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"codex","created_at":"2026-02-22T02:46:42.984607Z","updated_at":"2026-02-22T09:53:13.770293Z","closed_at":"2026-02-22T09:53:13.770295Z","ephemeral":false,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-34","depends_on_id":"bd-32","type":"blocks"},{"issue_id":"bd-34","depends_on_id":"bd-27","type":"blocks"},{"issue_id":"bd-34","depends_on_id":"bd-28","type":"discovered-from"}]}
