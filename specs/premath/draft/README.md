# Premath Draft Specs

This directory contains promoted **draft** specifications.

Draft specs are active contracts between editor and implementers and should be
treated as normative for claimed conformance profiles/capabilities.

Start here:

- `SPEC-INDEX.md` — front door for claims, profiles, and normative scope.
- `DOCTRINE-INF.md` — doctrine/infinity-layer preservation contract.
- `DOCTRINE-SITE.md` — doctrine-to-operation site map contract
  (`DOCTRINE-SITE.json`).
- `LLM-INSTRUCTION-DOCTRINE.md` — instruction typing/binding doctrine for
  LLM-driven control loops.
- `PREMATH-KERNEL.md` — semantic kernel contract.

Related:

- `../raw/` — experimental and informational specs not yet promoted.
