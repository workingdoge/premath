## License

This specification is dedicated to the public domain under **CC0 1.0** (see
`../../../LICENSE`).

## Change Process

This document is governed by the process in `../../process/coss.md`.

## 1. Purpose

This file is the **front door**. It answers:

- what is normative vs. informative,
- what claims an implementation may make,
- and how the ecosystem compiles to a small, checkable kernel.

Premath is designed to be **host-agnostic**. We treat “typechecker” and “∞-cosmos”
as *examples of external host bases* `B` in which Premath meanings are realized and/or checked.
Whether `B` is presented as a “type”, “term”, or other meta-object is an implementation detail.

Normative conformance requirements live in `draft/CONFORMANCE`.

## 2. The Premath shape (one total, two bases)

Premath’s semantic kernel is the fibre-space projection:

- `p₀ : E → 𝒞` where `𝒞` is the context world (covers/refinements are declared on it),
  and `E` is the total space of definables-in-context.

Implementations additionally choose an external host base `B` and a realization `F`
into a Premath-shaped bundle over `B`. See `draft/PREMATH-KERNEL` for the exact diagram and roles.

## 3. Claims and profiles (capability-based)

Premath avoids prescribing a single internal architecture. Instead, conformance is
defined by **claims**. An implementation MUST satisfy the requirements of every claim it asserts.

Claims are grouped into profiles:

- **Kernel**: semantic law only (reindexing coherence + contractible descent + refinement invariance).
- **Interop Core**: deterministic, exchangeable artifacts (KCIR + NF + ref binding + wire/errors).
- **Interop Full**: `Interop Core` + deterministic normalization, obligations, and gate enforcement.

Implementations MAY additionally claim profile overlays published under
`specs/premath/profile/`. Profile overlays are additive to base claims and are
normative only when explicitly claimed.

Details and required vectors are defined in `draft/CONFORMANCE` and `draft/CAPABILITY-VECTORS`.

Interop profiles should be read as evidence/representation profiles over one kernel.
The unifying feature is the kernel law outcome, not the wire representation.
Profile choice may change portability and artifact form, but must not change kernel meaning.

## 4. Reference architecture (optional)

The diagram below is a **reference pathway** for implementations that want deterministic,
portable interop artifacts (`ObjNF/MorNF`, `cmpRef`, `project_ref`, wire formats). It is not
the only valid architecture.

Conformance is judged at the boundaries an implementation exposes (parsers, normalizers,
verifiers, obligation checkers), not by whether it contains these exact boxes internally.

```
   source syntax / IR
 (DSL, KCIR builders, etc.)
            |
            | elaborate / compile (optional)
            v
   obligations Ω  +  candidate meaning
            |              |
            | discharge     | canonicalize / key (optional)
            v              v

            \              /
             \            /
              v          v
            kernel laws (p₀:E→𝒞)
     (stability + contractible descent + refinement invariance)
```

## 5. What is normative (by claim)

### 5.1 Always normative (Kernel claim)

- `draft/DOCTRINE-INF` — doctrine/infinity-layer preservation contract.
- `draft/PREMATH-KERNEL` — semantic kernel (contexts/covers + contractible descent).

### 5.2 Normative for Interop Core (only if claimed)

- `draft/KCIR-CORE`
- `draft/REF-BINDING`
- `draft/NF`
- `draft/WIRE-FORMATS`
- `draft/ERROR-CODES`

### 5.3 Normative for Interop Full (only if claimed)

Everything in Interop Core, plus:

- `draft/NORMALIZER`
- `draft/BIDIR-DESCENT`
- `draft/GATE`

### 5.4 Normative for optional evidence capabilities (only if claimed)

For capability identifiers and vectors defined in `draft/CAPABILITY-VECTORS`:

- `capabilities.normal_forms`
- `capabilities.kcir_witnesses`
- `capabilities.commitment_checkpoints`
- `capabilities.squeak_site`
- `capabilities.ci_witnesses`

Capability-specific normative specs include:

- `raw/SQUEAK-SITE` (for `capabilities.squeak_site`)
- `raw/PREMATH-CI` (for `capabilities.ci_witnesses`)
- `draft/LLM-INSTRUCTION-DOCTRINE` (for `capabilities.instruction_typing`)

- `profile/ADJOINTS-AND-SITES` (for `capabilities.adjoints_sites`)
- `draft/CHANGE-MORPHISMS` (for `capabilities.change_morphisms`)

Normative requirements apply only when the corresponding capability is claimed.

### 5.5 Informative and optional

The entries below are informative/default reading surfaces unless they are
explicitly claimed under §5.4 or §5.6.

- `draft/DOCTRINE-SITE` — machine-checkable doctrine-to-operation site map
  (`draft/DOCTRINE-SITE-SOURCE.json` + `draft/DOCTRINE-OP-REGISTRY.json` ->
  `draft/DOCTRINE-SITE.json`).
- `draft/SPEC-TRACEABILITY` — spec-to-check/vector coverage matrix with
  explicit gap targets.
- `draft/PREMATH-COHERENCE` — typed coherence-contract checker/witness model
  for repository control-plane surfaces (`draft/COHERENCE-CONTRACT.json`).
- `draft/COHERENCE-CONTRACT.json` — machine coherence contract artifact for
  deterministic checker execution.
- `draft/CONTROL-PLANE-CONTRACT.json` — shared typed control-plane constants
  (projection policy/check order + CI witness kinds) consumed by CI/coherence
  adapter surfaces.
- `draft/CAPABILITY-REGISTRY.json` — shared typed executable-capability
  registry consumed by conformance/docs/coherence parity surfaces.
- `draft/LLM-INSTRUCTION-DOCTRINE` — doctrine contract for typed LLM
  instruction flows (normative only when `capabilities.instruction_typing` is
  claimed).
- `draft/LLM-PROPOSAL-CHECKING` — proposal ingestion/checking contract for LLM
  proposal artifacts (normative only when
  `capabilities.instruction_typing` is claimed).
- `draft/UNIFICATION-DOCTRINE` — minimum-encoding/maximum-expressiveness
  architecture doctrine for canonical boundaries and deterministic projections.
- `draft/SPAN-SQUARE-CHECKING` — typed span/square witness contract for
  pipeline/base-change commutation in coherence checker surfaces.
- `raw/CTX-SITE` — informational site base (`Ctx`) + coverage (`J`) model for
  context/refinement decomposition.
- `raw/SHEAF-STACK` — informational presheaf/sheaf/stack rendering of
  transport/descent obligations.
- `raw/TORSOR-EXT` — informational torsor/extension/twist-class model for
  non-canonical split behavior.
- `raw/SEMANTICS-INFTOPOS` — presentation-free model sketch (informational).
- `raw/HYPERDESCENT` — optional strengthening: hyperdescent.
- `raw/UNIVERSE` — optional extension: universe + comprehension (Tarski-style).
- `raw/SPLIT-PRESENTATION` — guidance: strict IR vs. semantic equality.
- `raw/TUSK-CORE` — single-world operational runtime contracts (informational/raw).
- `raw/SQUEAK-CORE` — inter-world transport/composition contracts (informational/raw).
- `raw/SQUEAK-SITE` — runtime-location site contracts for Squeak/Cheese
  (normative only when `capabilities.squeak_site` is claimed).
- `raw/PREMATH-CI` — higher-order CI/CD control-loop contract (normative only
  when `capabilities.ci_witnesses` is claimed).
- `raw/CI-TOPOS` — closure-style CI projection discipline (informational/raw).
- `docs/foundations/` — explanatory notes (non-normative).

Raw capability-spec lifecycle policy:

- Raw capability specs MAY be exercised by executable vectors, but remain
  lifecycle-raw until promotion criteria are met.
- Capability claims bind only the capability-scoped normative clauses listed in
  §5.4; raw status still means the full document text is open to iteration.
- Promotion from raw to draft for capability-scoped specs requires:
  1) deterministic golden/adversarial/invariance vectors for every claimed law
     boundary;
  2) deterministic witness/failure-class mapping through checker/run surfaces;
  3) issue-backed migration plan + decision-log entry for lifecycle change.

Current tracked promotion queue:

- `raw/SQUEAK-SITE` — tracked by issue `bd-44` (raw-retain path recorded in
  Decision 0040; promote only when criteria are met).
- `raw/TUSK-CORE` — tracked by issue `bd-45` (raw-retain path recorded in
  Decision 0041; promote only when criteria are met).

### 5.6 Normative for profile overlays (only if claimed)

- `profile/ADJOINTS-AND-SITES` — capability-scoped adjoint/site overlay:
  admissible-map allowlist policy, Beck-Chevalley obligations, and deterministic
  `(normalizerId, policyDigest)` discharge binding for profile claims.

Joint capability note:

- Implementations MAY jointly claim `capabilities.adjoints_sites` and
  `capabilities.squeak_site`; such compositions SHOULD follow lane separation
  and single-authority encoding rules in `draft/UNIFICATION-DOCTRINE` §9.

## 7. Notes on restrictiveness

- The kernel is intentionally small and closed.
- Interop is intentionally strict when claimed: it exists to make independent implementations converge.
- Implementations that do not exchange artifacts (e.g., proof-assistant-internal models) MAY omit
  interop machinery, and should simply refrain from making the corresponding interop claims.
