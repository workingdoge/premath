## License

This specification is dedicated to the public domain under **CC0 1.0** (see
`../../../LICENSE`).

## Change Process

This document is governed by the process in `../../process/coss.md`.

## Language

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**,
**SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this
specification are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 (and RFC 8174 for
capitalization).

## 1. Scope

This document defines an informational base category and coverage shape
`(Ctx, J)` for Premath context semantics.

It does not change normative kernel or Gate authority:

- `draft/PREMATH-KERNEL`
- `draft/GATE`
- `draft/BIDIR-DESCENT`
- `draft/PREMATH-COHERENCE`

## 2. Runtime entities (existing surfaces)

The site shape is attached to existing runtime entities:

- `ContextProvider`: lineage resolution and restriction/pullback support.
- `EventStore`: append/read/fold substrate with replay head refs.
- `DomainAdapter`: local states, overlap compatibility evidence, glue proposals.
- `PremathWorld`/kernel: ambient definability semantics.
- `Tusk` unit: recursive local solver producing summary + witness outputs.

This document adds only categorical structure over those existing surfaces.

## 3. Base category `Ctx`

### 3.1 Objects

An object `Gamma` in `Ctx` is a context slice containing at least:

- `context_id`
- `ctx_ref`
- `data_head_ref`
- domain-level parameters needed for deterministic replay/validation.

### 3.2 Morphisms

A morphism `rho: Gamma' -> Gamma` is a refinement/restriction map and denotes:

- `Gamma'` carries at least the constraints/information of `Gamma`.
- all semantic objects admit reindexing along `rho`.

### 3.3 Pullback availability

`Ctx` SHOULD admit pullbacks up to equivalence. Operationally, for
`rho: Gamma' -> Gamma` and `sigma: Delta -> Gamma`, the runtime SHOULD provide a
deterministic refinement context for `Gamma' x_Gamma Delta`.

`ContextProvider` is the expected implementation boundary for this operation.

## 4. Coverage `J` from admissible covers

For each context `Gamma`, a cover is a family `{rho_i: Gamma_i -> Gamma}` that
jointly carries enough information for global meaning.

`J` is generated by admissible covers emitted by:

- kernel cover decomposition, and/or
- domain adapter cover decomposition.

Coverage SHOULD satisfy:

1. Identity: `{id_Gamma: Gamma -> Gamma}` is a cover.
2. Base-change stability: pullback of a cover along any map is a cover.
3. Transitivity: cover-of-covers composes to a cover.

These are the minimum constraints needed for descent-style glue checks.

## 5. Operational reading

- A cover is the exact decomposition shape Tusk is allowed to branch into.
- Overlap compatibility is the local agreement check.
- Global glue is an admissibility obligation, not a heuristic.

Failure to satisfy admissible-cover obligations maps to standard failure
surfaces (for example locality/descent/glue classes) at the checker boundary.

## 6. Minimum-encoding boundary

This site layer SHOULD stay minimal:

- do not duplicate kernel admissibility semantics here,
- do not add a new authority path for acceptance,
- treat site objects/morphisms as structure used by existing checker and
  witness pipelines.
