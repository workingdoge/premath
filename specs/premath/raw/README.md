# Premath Raw Specs

This directory contains **raw** (experimental/informational) specifications.

Promoted contract specs live in `../draft/` and are the default normative
surface for active conformance claims.

Use this directory for:

- experiments not yet promoted,
- optional model notes,
- exploratory registries and roadmaps.

Current raw tracks include:

- kernel-oriented extensions (`NORMALIZER`, `DSL`, `OPCODES`, `HYPERDESCENT`, `UNIVERSE`),
- operational runtime stack (`TUSK-CORE`, `SQUEAK-CORE`, `SQUEAK-SITE`, `PREMATH-CI`, `CI-TOPOS`),
- explanatory semantics/presentation notes (`SEMANTICS-INFTOPOS`, `SPLIT-PRESENTATION`).

For lifecycle and promotions, see:

- `../../process/coss.md`
- `../../process/decision-log.md`
