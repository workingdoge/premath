# Premath Raw Specs

This directory contains **raw** (experimental/informational) specifications.

Promoted contract specs live in `../draft/` and are the default normative
surface for active conformance claims.

Use this directory for:

- experiments not yet promoted,
- optional model notes,
- exploratory registries and roadmaps.

Current raw tracks include:

- kernel-oriented extensions (`DSL`, `OPCODES`, `HYPERDESCENT`, `UNIVERSE`),
- operational runtime stack (`TUSK-CORE`, `SQUEAK-CORE`, `SQUEAK-SITE`,
  `FIBER-CONCURRENCY`, `PREMATH-CI`, `CI-TOPOS`),
- control world-profile sketches (`WORLD-PROFILES-CONTROL`, including optional
  torsor/extension overlay posture),
- coordination/lease profile (`BEAM-COORDINATION`),
- site/semantic geometry notes (`CTX-SITE`, `SHEAF-STACK`, `TORSOR-EXT`),
- explanatory semantics/presentation notes (`SEMANTICS-INFTOPOS`, `SPLIT-PRESENTATION`).

Recent promotion: `NORMALIZER` moved to `../draft/NORMALIZER.md`.
