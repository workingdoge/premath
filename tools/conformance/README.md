# Conformance Tools

This directory contains lightweight conformance validation helpers.

## `check_stub_invariance.py`

Validates capability fixture stubs in:

- `tests/conformance/fixtures/capabilities/`

Checks include:

- `manifest.json` integrity and vector membership,
- `case.json` / `expect.json` existence and JSON validity,
- consistency (`capabilityId`, `vectorId`),
- invariance pair completeness (`semanticScenarioId` grouped pairs),
- invariance assertion presence for kernel verdict and Gate class stability.

Run:

```bash
python3 tools/conformance/check_stub_invariance.py
```

## `run_capability_vectors.py`

Runs executable capability vectors (current set):

- `capabilities.normal_forms`
- `capabilities.kcir_witnesses`
- `capabilities.commitment_checkpoints`
- `capabilities.squeak_site`
- `capabilities.ci_witnesses`
- `capabilities.instruction_typing`

Checks include:

- deterministic accept/reject outcomes for each vector,
- normalizer/policy binding behavior for normalized-mode vectors,
- SqueakSite location descriptor/overlap/glue behavior,
- instruction-envelope to CI witness determinism checks,
- typed/unknown instruction classification determinism checks,
- invariance pairing (`kernelVerdict` and Gate failure classes) across evidence profiles.

Run:

```bash
python3 tools/conformance/run_capability_vectors.py
```

## `check_doctrine_site.py`

Validates doctrine-to-operation site coherence using:

- `specs/premath/draft/DOCTRINE-INF.md` (morphism registry),
- `specs/premath/draft/DOCTRINE-SITE.json` (site map),
- declaration-bearing spec sections (`Doctrine Preservation Declaration (v0)`),
- operation entrypoints referenced in the site map.

Checks include:

- declaration presence and exact set coherence (`preserved`/`notPreserved`),
- edge morphism validity against doctrine registry,
- cover/node references,
- reachability from doctrine root to all operation nodes.

Run:

```bash
python3 tools/conformance/check_doctrine_site.py
```
