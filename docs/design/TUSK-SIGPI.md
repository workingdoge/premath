# Tusk SigPi (Compatibility Alias)

Status: draft
Scope: design-level, non-normative

This file is retained as a compatibility path.

Canonical runtime transport/placement design guidance now lives in:

- `SQUEAK-DESIGN.md`

Boundary reminder:

- Tusk = execution inside one world.
- Squeak/SigPi = runtime placement + inter-world transport.
- Kernel/Gate = semantic admissibility authority.
