# Docs Index

This directory contains non-normative documentation and implementation notes.

- `design/README.md` — architecture and runtime design notes (Tusk/SigPi, identity, witnessing, CI closure, higher-order CI/CD loop).
- `design/CI-PROVIDER-BINDINGS.md` — provider-specific CI check bindings (GitHub example; canonical gate contract remains provider-agnostic).
- `design/ARCHITECTURE-MAP.md` — one-page doctrine-to-operation architecture map.
- `design/GLOSSARY.md` — shared terminology used across design docs.
- `foundations/` — explanatory background notes for kernel and SigPi concepts.
- `../specs/premath/draft/SPEC-INDEX.md` — normative spec entrypoint and claim/profile map.

For process/governance, see `../specs/process/README.md`.
