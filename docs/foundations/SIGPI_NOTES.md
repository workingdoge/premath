# SigΠ and the Total Shape (notes)

These notes are non-normative.

## Two levels

- **Premath (kernel)**: internal definability contract (reindexing + contractible descent).
- **SigΠ (external doctrine)**: composition *between* Premath-worlds; where world-to-world transport,
  change-of-site, and ambidextrous adjunctions live.

## Interpretation

A useful reading is:

- Premath is the internal “effect theory” of definability (allowed effects: pullback + descent).
- SigΠ is the external category/doctrine whose morphisms preserve Premath structure, and whose
  distinguished class \(\mathcal G\) supports ambidexterity (when applicable).

## Totality / universe tower

If Premath-valid definitions can themselves describe constructors/worlds, one obtains a tower:

- codes for definables
- codes for worlds/constructors
- codes for SigΠ morphisms (where admissible)

To avoid paradox, treat the “total shape” as stratified (universe levels) rather than a single fixed point
unless you have an explicit Tarski-style universe discipline.
