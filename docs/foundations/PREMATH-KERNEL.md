# Premath Kernel

Premath is a kernel doctrine of definability: a notion is admissible exactly when it is
**stable under context change** and **glues uniquely from locally compatible data**.

Premath is **ontology-agnostic**: it does not prescribe what definables *are* (sets,
groupoids, ∞-groupoids, …). It only prescribes how they must **behave** under reindexing
and descent.

---

## Ambient coherence level

Premath is parameterized by an ambient “sameness level” \(\mathcal V\), e.g.

\[
\mathcal V \in \{\mathbf{Set},\ \mathbf{Gpd},\ \mathbf{Cat},\ \mathcal S_\infty,\ \ldots\}.
\]

- In \(\mathbf{Set}\): sameness is equality.
- In \(\mathbf{Gpd}/\mathbf{Cat}\): sameness is isomorphism.
- In \(\mathcal S_\infty\): sameness is equivalence.

Write \(A \approx B\) for equivalence in \(\mathcal V\).
Reserve \(A \equiv B\) for definitional/algorithmic equality in an implementation.

**Recommended default:** \(\mathcal V = \mathcal S_\infty\). Set/groupoid versions are truncations.

---

## Contexts and covers

A Premath world consists of:

1. **Contexts:** a category \(\mathcal C\) with objects \(\Gamma\) and morphisms
   \(f:\Gamma'\to\Gamma\).
2. **Covers:** a coverage / Grothendieck pretopology \(\mathrm{Cov}\). A cover of \(\Gamma\) is a family
   \[
   U=\{u_i:\Gamma_i\to\Gamma\}\ \triangleright\ \Gamma.
   \]

Assume pullbacks of covering maps exist so overlaps \(\Gamma_i\times_\Gamma\Gamma_j\) are available.

---

## Indexed definables

Premath assigns to each context \(\Gamma\) an object of definables
\[
\mathrm{Def}(\Gamma)\in\mathcal V,
\]
and to each morphism \(f:\Gamma'\to\Gamma\) a reindexing map (pullback)
\[
f^*:\mathrm{Def}(\Gamma)\to\mathrm{Def}(\Gamma').
\]

**Indexed coherence requirement:** \(\mathrm{Def}:\mathcal C^{op}\to\mathcal V\) is a pseudo/∞-functor
appropriate to \(\mathcal V\). Reindexing coherence is *structure*, not an optional add-on.

---

## Stability (reindexing coherence)

For every \(A\in\mathrm{Def}(\Gamma)\):

- **Unit:** \((id_\Gamma)^*A \approx A\)
- **Composition:** \((g\circ f)^*A \approx f^*(g^*A)\)

with the standard coherence laws demanded by \(\mathcal V\).

---

## Locality (restriction to covers)

Given a cover \(U=\{u_i:\Gamma_i\to\Gamma\}\triangleright\Gamma\), any \(A\in\mathrm{Def}(\Gamma)\)
restricts to
\[
A_i := u_i^*A\in\mathrm{Def}(\Gamma_i).
\]

On overlaps, with projections
\[
p_1:\Gamma_i\times_\Gamma\Gamma_j\to\Gamma_i,\quad
p_2:\Gamma_i\times_\Gamma\Gamma_j\to\Gamma_j,
\]
we can compare \(p_1^*A_i\) and \(p_2^*A_j\) in \(\mathrm{Def}(\Gamma_i\times_\Gamma\Gamma_j)\).

---

## Descent data

A **descent datum** over \(U\triangleright\Gamma\) consists of:

- local definables \(A_i\in\mathrm{Def}(\Gamma_i)\), and
- overlap compatibilities \(\phi_{ij}:p_1^*A_i\approx p_2^*A_j\)

satisfying the usual cocycle coherence on triple overlaps (in the sense of \(\mathcal V\)).

Let \(\mathrm{Desc}_U(\Gamma)\) denote the \(\mathcal V\)-object of descent data.
There is a canonical restriction map
\[
\mathrm{res}_U:\mathrm{Def}(\Gamma)\to\mathrm{Desc}_U(\Gamma).
\]

---

## Coherence axiom: contractible descent

Premath’s core axiom is:

**Contractible Descent (Effective Descent).**
For every cover \(U\triangleright\Gamma\), the restriction map
\(\mathrm{res}_U\) is an equivalence in \(\mathcal V\).

Equivalently, for each descent datum \(d\in\mathrm{Desc}_U(\Gamma)\), the “Glue-space”
\[
\mathrm{Glue}(d):=\mathrm{fib}_d(\mathrm{res}_U)
\]
is contractible (in \(\mathcal V\)).

This single axiom specializes as:

- sheaf condition when \(\mathcal V=\mathbf{Set}\),
- stack condition when \(\mathcal V=\mathbf{Gpd}\),
- higher stack condition when \(\mathcal V=\mathcal S_\infty\).

---

## Refinement closure

Let \(J\) be the Grothendieck topology generated by \(\mathrm{Cov}\).
Premath descent is required for all \(J\)-covers, not just generating families.

Operationally: passing to a finer cover must not change meaning (up to \(\approx\)).

---

## Rejection criteria

A purported definable notion is not Premath-admissible if it is:

- **Non-stable:** meaning changes under reindexing.
- **Non-local:** cannot restrict along covers.
- **Non-gluable:** compatible locals do not produce a global.
- **Non-unique:** gluing is not contractible.
- **Refinement-sensitive:** meaning changes under refinement without \(\approx\)-identification.

---

## Summary

A Premath kernel is:

- a context category \(\mathcal C\),
- a coverage \(\mathrm{Cov}\) (hence topology \(J\)),
- an indexed \(\mathcal V\)-object \(\mathrm{Def}:\mathcal C^{op}\to\mathcal V\),
- and **contractible descent** for all \(J\)-covers.

Everything else (codes, IRs, normalizers, external ambidexterity, protocol instantiations)
is a **model/realizer** or an **extension** built on this kernel.
